      <p class="details">The James Webb Space Telescope spotted water vapor in Comet 238P/Read, which orbits between Mars and Jupiter. This means water has been hiding in space rocks for billions of years! Scientists are excited because it helps explain how Earth got its water. But there's a mystery—no carbon dioxide was found, which is usually there with water. So, space detectives are on the case!</p>

      <p class="details">Comet 3I/ATLAS is an interstellar visitor, unlike others in our Solar System. It follows a path that takes it back to space. Scientists expect its closest approach to the Sun, or perihelion, on 29 October 2025. The comet’s tail emerges as it nears the Sun. Its tail is created by ice sublimating into gas and dust. It was actively degassing for an unusually long distance past Jupiter's orbit. </p>

      <p class="details">A team led by scientists at the Southwest Research Institute (SwRI) in Colorado made 10 different 40-minute exposures of Uranus using JWST's Near-Infrared Camera (NIRCam) in order to find the small moon. Its discovery brings the total number of known Uranian moons to 29.</p>
