    <p id="story">ðŸ“– Story: Long ago, computers couldnâ€™t talk to each other easily. At a science lab called CERN, a clever man named Tim Berners-Lee had a big idea. He imagined a magical way to link information so people everywhere could share and learn. In 1989, he invented the World Wide Web using special tools like HTML, URLs, and HTTP. Tim didnâ€™t keep it for himselfâ€”he made it free for everyone! Thanks to him, we can now explore websites, watch videos, and learn anything with just a click.</p>
