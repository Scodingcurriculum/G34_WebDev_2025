    <p id="story">Albert Einstein was born in Germany in 1879. As a child, he was quiet and didnâ€™t do well in school, but he loved asking questions and exploring science. At age 5, a compass sparked his curiosity about invisible forces. He grew up to become one of the worldâ€™s greatest scientists, changing how we understand space, time, and light. In 1921, he won the Nobel Prize for his work on light. Even though he was famous, Einstein stayed humble and believed imagination was more important than knowledge.</p>
